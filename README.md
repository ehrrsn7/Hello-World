# Hello, World!

This is a simple hello-world program, written in python.

- To run this, download or clone the code onto your computer and run using a python interpreter.
- If you do not have a python interpreter on your computer, this will not work. The simplest way to do this is to open VS Code or another IDE, open the .py file and let the IDE download the correct interpreter. Otherwise, clear instructions on how to download Python are found [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

*note: this is mainly for my experimentation in creating a clearly-documented public repository, as well as learning the ins-and-outs of GitHub. That being said, if there are any suggestions to be made or any improvements, please leave a comment either here or on the youtube video (link below)*
